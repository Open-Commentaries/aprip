    <h2>Introductory Remarks by Gregory Nagy 2022</h2>
    <p>
      I restart what I had described as an ongoing project in a posting for Classical Inquiries (Nagy 2020.08.07): https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/ongoing-comments-on-a-pausanias-reader-in-progress/. My description there, in the introduction to that post, is by now out of date. My description here presents a new idea about the ongoing project as I had described it there. Having found for it a new home in Classical Continuum, I have merged a restarted version of A Pausanias Commentary in Progress, which I had abbreviated as APCIP, with a restarted version of A Pausanias Reader in Progress, abbreviated as APRIP. In the new Reader, my ongoing commentary, in the form of annotations, has been combined with my long-term ongoing project of retranslating all ten scrolls of the Greek text of Pausanias wherever I think that updating is needed for the original translation by W. H. S. Jones, 1918 (Scroll 2 translated by Jones together with H. A. Ormerod). Starting in 2022, my annotations will be enhanced by other contributors of content. In the case of each new contribution, including mine, the contributor’s name and the date of writing will be indicated.
